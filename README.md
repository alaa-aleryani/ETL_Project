# ETL_Project

This project builds an ETL pipeline via separate data files regarding crowdfunding.

Part 1: In this part, we used the crowdfunding.xlsx file that we were provided with to create a category and subcategory dataframes. 

Part 2: This part cloned the crowdfunding Excel file used in part 1, which was then cleaned and merged with the subcategory and category data frames created in part 1. The result was csv file that can be used to filter and search for a company's campaign information including by category and subcategory.

Part 3:  An Excel file of contact information was cleaned using Pandas.  The result was a clean csv file that can be efficiently used to filter and search for a contact's first_name, last_name, and email.

Part 4: This part was mainly based on using SQL. Looking at the four CSV files that were made prior, I had to make an ERD using the QuickDBD which was then converted into a schema.
